# SALES-PREDICTION-USING-PYTHON
Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising theirproduct. So letâ€™s start the task of sales prediction with machine learning using Python.

Step 1: Data Collection
Gather historical sales data, advertising spending, and other relevant features you want to consider for your prediction.

Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Clean and preprocess the data. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features if necessary.

Step 3: Data Exploration and Visualization
Analyze the data to gain insights into patterns and relationships that can help in model selection and feature engineering.

Step 4: Feature Engineering
Create new features or transform existing ones to improve the model's predictive power.

Step 5: Split Data into Training and Testing Sets
Divide your data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the machine learning model, and the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.

Step 6: Choose a Machine Learning Algorithm
Depending on your data and problem, we can choose various regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting.

Step 7: Train the Model
Train the selected model using the training data.

Step 8: Evaluate the Model
Use evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to assess the model's performance on the testing data.

Step 9: Hyperparameter Tuning
If necessary, tune the hyperparameters of your chosen model to optimize its performance.


Step 10: Make Predictions
Once you have a trained and optimized model, you can use it to make sales predictions based on new data.
